####Questions and Answers

#####What URL should be used to access your application?
* Access the application at <https://stark-retreat-45895.herokuapp.com/index.html#/>

#####What libraries did you use to write your application?
* Node.js, Angular.js, and Bootstrap for styling.

#####What influenced the design of your user interface?
* Ease of use and visual appeal. The application includes two main functions to access state info and post messages about the user's experience relative to those states. With a basic structure already provided on the server/back end side, using Angular to design the client-side left more options for design and user experience.  

#####What steps did you take to make your applciation user friendly?
* I kept that information easily accessible and understandable with a simple user experience design. We needed a simple login, access to info, and ability to post.  Three sections for user experience easily divided via simple navbar design. All design elements are easily readable and keep with the soft black-and-white color scheme. 

#####What steps did you take to insure your application was secure?
* Designed a user authentication for login in the maincontroller. Backend provides already approved users so basic auth ensures access to those users. Unapproved users may not access the application with an alert.

#####What could be done to the front end or back end to make it more secure?
* Providing an option to sign up for applciation use with third-party authentication like Google Oauth or Facebook Oauth would ensure that extra level of security for those users who have been approved.
